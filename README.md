# How to contribute the code for Nagisa
- You should send an e-mail to Mouri_Naruto@Outlook.com first.
- If you add a larger piece of code, you can opt to make that file or set of 
  files to use a different license as long as they don't enforce any changes to
  the rest of the package and they make sense. Such "separate parts" can not be
  copyleft licensed (As I think the copyleft is another type license of 
  proprietary softwares and I don't want to make troubles to users), but they 
  must use "GPL compatible" licenses (As I want to allow users to use this 
  project properly in GPL licensed environments).
- If you have not mentioned, the source code which you have contributed will 
  use the same license as this project's.
