**Warning: This project is in the preview stage until the 1.0 is released.**

Nagisa is an open source download utility that supports multi languages. 
Running in the Windows Universal Platform, its distributed under the MIT 
License.

Nagisa is written in C++/CX and uses pure WinRT API, Win32 API, WRL and STL 
which ensures a higher execution speed and smaller program size. By optimizing
as many routines as possible without losing user friendliness, Nagisa is trying
to reduce the world carbon dioxide emissions. When using less CPU power, the PC
can throttle down and reduce power consumption, resulting in a greener 
environment.

You're encouraged to translate Nagisa into your native language if there's not 
already a translation present in the Nagisa's GitHub Repository.

> P.S. The above introduction is inspired by the Notepad++ project.
