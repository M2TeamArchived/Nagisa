**Warning: This project is in early stages of development, the final product 
may differ from what you see now.**

Nagisa is an open source file transfer utility (UWP), distributed under the MIT
License. 

Nagisa is mainly developed in C++ 17, with WinRT API, Win32 API, WRL, STL, 
C++/CX and C++/WinRT. Thus it has better efficiency and consumes less storage
space. 

We need help to translate Nagisa into native languages that have not been 
supported.
