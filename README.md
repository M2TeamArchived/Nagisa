**Warning: This project is in the preview stage until the 1.0 is released.**

Nagisa is an open source download utility that supports multi languages. 
Running in the Windows Universal Platform, its distributed under the MIT 
License.

All source code of Nagisa is written in C++ with the C++ 17 standard and uses 
pure WinRT API, Win32 API, WRL, STL, C++/CX and C++/WinRT which ensures a 
higher execution speed and smaller program size. By optimizing as many routines
as possible without losing user friendliness, Nagisa is trying to reduce the 
world carbon dioxide emissions. When using less CPU power, the PC can throttle
down and reduce power consumption, resulting in a greener environment.

You're encouraged to translate Nagisa into your native language if there's not 
already a translation present in the Nagisa's GitHub Repository.

> P.S. The above introduction is inspired by the Notepad++ project.
